Select the "Distance" folder.

Set the status to "Confirmed/Active".

Set the start date by clicking the first field next to "Date":

Set the end date by clicking the field after "until":

Set the deadline to sometime after the event so that you can still register any stragglers.

Click the "Location" tab on the top and enter in the event's address.

Click "save" at the bottom.

### Edit the Event URL

You should be taken to the event's details page.

!

Click on the "Edit URL" link around the middle of the page.

Choose a UNIQUE landing page URL for this. For example, if you are attending the 2019 UPCEA conference, choose something like "upcea_2019".


### Acquire students
From here, right-click on the now-customized URL and click "Open Link in New Tab". You should be able to see the form, like so. If you do not, check to make sure you set the dates correctly.

If the form is live, copy the URL for the registration page and email it to anyone attending the event.

While at the event, open the form on an internet-equipped device for prospective students to fill out.
