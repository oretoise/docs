## Data Points
The following is a list of methods to add new prospects to Slate directly or to provide a way for people to add themselves via landing pages or inquiry forms.

For everything except opting someone out of email communications, you'll need to click on "Edit Record" in the top right, when viewing a record.

### Changing Program / Communication Plan
Once you see the Edit Form, scroll down to Academic Information, and you'll see the program drop-down list.

### Anticipated Entry Term

### Opting Out of Emails

### Opting out of Text Messages (SMS)

## What Not to Do
Because so many things in Slate depend on the 'Campus' field being set to 'Online Education', adding a prospect via the "New Person" form (screenshot) is inadvisable. It will add the prospect, but you will not see them in our populations, your queries, etc.
