# Exporting Prospects
{: .fs-9 }

In Slate, you can easily export prospect data into spreadsheets or other file types for reporting, emailing, etc. Here's how to do it.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## From a Query
In Slate, as a program coordinator or manager, you already have access to basic program-based queries. If you need to put together a mailing list, these are more than sufficient. 

Simply select the query you need.

![Queries]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/queries.png)

Next, click "Run Query"

![Run Query]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/run_query.png)

At the top, you can click on the dropdown for "Output", then select the type you want. For most cases, Excel Spreadsheet is probably what you are looking for.

![Output Selection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/output_selection.png)

Click Export. The file will now be downloaded.

## From a Report
Reports function a bit differently than standard queries. As such, it is not a simple task to export data from them to spreadsheets, but if you would like to share their results, exporting to PDF is straightforward.

Go to the report. You'll find these under the Queries / Report tab up top.

## From an Event
To export prospect data from an Event in Slate, go the Events tab.
