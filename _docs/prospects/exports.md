# Exporting Prospects
{: .fs-9 }

In Slate, you can easily export prospect data into spreadsheets or other file types for reporting, emailing, etc. Here's how to do it.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## From a Query
In Slate, as a program coordinator or manager, you already have access to basic program-based queries. If you need to put together a mailing list, these are more than sufficient. 

Simply select the query you need.

![Queries]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/queries.png)

Next, click "Run Query"

![Run Query]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/run_query.png)

At the top, you can click on the dropdown for "Output", then select the type you want. For most cases, Excel Spreadsheet is probably what you are looking for.

![Output Selection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/output_selection.png)

Click Export. The file will now be downloaded.

![Export]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/export.png)

## From a Report
Reports function a bit differently than standard queries. As such, it is not a simple task to export data from them to spreadsheets, but if you would like to share their results, exporting to PDF is straightforward.

Go to the report. You'll find these under the Queries / Report tab up top.

![Queries / Reports Tab]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/queries_tab.png)

Click on the Reports link on the right-hand side.

![Reports Link]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/reports_link.png)

Select the report you wish to download as a PDF.

![Report Selection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/report_selection.png)

Click "Export to PDF" on the right-hand side.

![Report Selection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/export_pdf.png)

You can save the PDF, download it, email it, etc. from your web browser.

## From an Event
To export prospect data from an Event in Slate, go the Events tab.

![Events Button]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/events_nav.png)

Click on the Events homepage link.

![Link to the Events page.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/events_nav2.png)

Find the event you wish to pull prospects from and select it. We will use the August 2019 Toyota Education Fair for an example.

![Event Selection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/event_selection.png)

Open the event.

![Event Page]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/event_page.png)

Click on "Export Data" on the right-hand side.

![Export Data]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/export_data_button.png)

Select your choice of output. For most things, Excel Spreadsheet is likely what you need.

![Output Selection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/prospects/event_output_selection.png)

Click Export. The file will now download.
