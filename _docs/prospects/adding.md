# Adding Prospects to Slate
There are several ways to add new prospects to Slate, but the important part is to set things up correctly so that you always know where they originally came from. This is crucial in determining ad campaign and event performance.

## Methods
The following is a list of methods to add new prospects to Slate directly or to provide a way for people to add themselves via landing pages or inquiry forms.

### Inquiry Form

### Landing Pages

### Events

### Direct via Internal Form

### File Import

## What Not to Do
Because so many things in Slate depend on the 'Distance Student' field being set, adding a prospect via the "New Person" form (screenshot) is inadvisable. It will add the prospect, but you will not see them in our populations, your queries, etc.
