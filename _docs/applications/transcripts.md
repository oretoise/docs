# How to Evaluate Transcripts in Slate
While this will hopefully change in the future, this details the current process for evaluating transcripts for transfer applicants in Slate. It involves downloading the transcript PDF, marking it up in Adobe Acrobat Pro, then uploading the evaluated transcript into Slate. Doing this also allows you to input data that speaks to Banner's system, SOAPCOL.

## 1. Looking up the Applicant's Record
Say you are reviewing an application in the Reader, like so:

![An app in the reader.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/reader.png)

You see they have **official** transcripts and need to evaluate them.

![An official transcript.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/example_transcripts.png)

The first step will be to go from the Reader directly to their Person Record in Slate. You can do this by clicking their name at the top of the Reader.

![Link to their record.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/record_link.png)

Now click on "Lookup Application". This will open their person record in a new tab.

![Location of "lookup applicatoin" link.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/applicant_link.png)

This will open their person record, like so:

![A view of the Person Record, application tab.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/application_view.png)

## 2. Downloading transcripts as PDF files
From the application tab, scroll down and you should see a list of materials, documents associated with the application.

![The materials list]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/materials_list.png)

Find the one you want to evaluate, and select it.

![Selecting a material]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/material_selection.png)

This will bring up the Material information window. Click on "Display" to view the material as a PDF document.

![Link to display material]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/display_button.png)

That opens the document in a new tab. From here, click the small printer icon in the top-left row.

![The printer button]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/printer_button.png)

This opens your browser's built-in PDF viewer. From here, you will want to click the download button. In Firefox, this looks like a page with a downward-pointing arrow, seen below.

![Firefox's PDF viewer.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/downloading_pdf.png)

In Chrome, the download button looks like this:

![Chrome's PDF download button.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/chrome_pdf_button.png)

Either one will launch a traditional Save As dialog. Select your download location and hit Save.

## 3. Evaluating using Adobe Acrobat Pro.
This guide is not meant to replace Admissions' process for evaluating transcripts, merely to show you the tools in Acrobat to make it possible. You can find these tools under the "Comment" menu on the right-hand side.

![Acrobat's Comment Tools]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/comment_tools.png)

### a. Red Line Tool
To mark through courses with a red line, use the red line tool, located here:

![Red line tool]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/red_line.png)

With the tool active, highlight the text you want to mark through.

### b. Text Box
To add text, select the text-box tool. Click where you want to begin typing, then type your text.

![Text box tool]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/text_box.png)

To change fonts, text color, and size, use the small "Add Text Comment" window/box that appears:

![Add text comment window]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/add_text_comment.png)

### c. Highlighter
Highlighting text works exactly the same as the red-line tool. Simply select the highlighter and highlight the text.

![Red line tool]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/highlighter.png)

## 4. Talking to SOAPCOL
From a person record in Slate, like so:

![A view of the Person Record, application tab.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/application_view.png)

Click on the Profile tab. This should have a listing of their prior schools.

![Profile tab]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/person_record_profile_tab.png)

For the transcript you evaluated, select the respective school.

![Selecting the school]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/select_school.png)

This will bring up the Edit form for that institution. From here you can add the ADMR code, the recalculated GPA, etc.

![Institution Edit Form]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/institution_edit_form.png)

## 5. Uploading an "MSU Evalutated Transcript"
From the person record in Slate, select either the Application or Materials tab, like so:

![The materials list]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/materials_list.png)

Select "New Material".

![The materials list]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/new_material.png)

This will bring up the material uploader. The **important** part here is that you change Record to the school.

![Material Uploader]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/material_uploader.png)

![Material Uploader]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/material_uploader_select.png)

This will allow you to select "MSU Evaluated Transcript" for the Material choice. Simply select your evaluated transcript file using the Browse button, and hit Upload.
