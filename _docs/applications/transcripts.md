# How to Evaluate Transcripts in Slate
While this will hopefully change in the future, this details the current process for evaluating transcripts for transfer applicants in Slate. It involves downloading the transcript PDF, marking it up in Adobe Acrobat Pro, then uploading the evaluated transcript into Slate. Doing this also allows you to input data that speaks to Banner's system, SOAPCOL.

## 1. Looking up the Applicant's Record
Say you are reviewing an application in the Reader, like so:

![An app in the reader.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/reader.png)

You see they have **official** transcripts and need to evaluate them.

![An official transcript.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/example_transcripts.png)

The first step will be to go from the Reader directly to their Person Record in Slate. You can do this by clicking their name at the top of the Reader.

![Link to their record.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/record_link.png)

Now click on "Lookup Application". This will open their person record in a new tab.

This will open their person record, like so:

![A view of the Person Record, application tab.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/application_view.png)

## 2. Downloading transcripts as PDF files
From the application tab, scroll down and you should see a list of materials, documents associated with the application.

![The materials list]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/materials_list.png)

Find the one you want to evaluate, and select it.

![Selecting a material]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/material_selection.png)

This will bring up the Material information window. Click on "Display" to view the material as a PDF document.

![Link to display material]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/display_button.png)

That opens the document in a new tab. From here, click the small printer icon in the top-left row.

![The printer button]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/printer_button.png)

This opens your browser's built-in PDF viewer. From here, you will want to click the download button. In Firefox, this looks like a page with a downward-pointing arrow, seen below.

![Firefox's PDF viewer.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/downloading_pdf.png)

In Chrome, the download button looks like this:

![Chrome's PDF download button.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/chrome_pdf_button.png)

Either one will launch a traditional Save As dialog. Select your download location and hit Save.
