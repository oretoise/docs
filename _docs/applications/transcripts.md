# How to Evaluate Transcripts in Slate
While this will hopefully change in the future, this details the current process for evaluating transcripts for transfer applicants in Slate. It involves downloading the transcript PDF, marking it up in Adobe Acrobat Pro, then uploading the evaluated transcript into Slate. Doing this also allows you to input data that speaks to Banner's system, SOAPCALS (or w/e it is...).

## 1. Looking up the Applicant's Record
Say you are reviewing an application in the Reader, like so:

![An app in the reader.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/reader.png)

You see they have **official** transcripts and need to evaluate them.

![An official transcript.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/example_transcripts.png)

The first step will be to go from the Reader directly to their Person Record in Slate. You can do this by clicking their name at the top of the Reader.

![Link to their record.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/record_link.png)

Now click on "Lookup Application". This will open their person record in a new tab.

![Location of "lookup applicatoin" link.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/applicant_link.png)

This will open their person record, like so:

![A view of the Person Record, application tab.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/applications/evaluating-transcripts/application_view.png)
