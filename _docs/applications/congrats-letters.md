{: .no_toc }
Sending congrats letters is fairly easy, but in order for things to look right, you'll need to follow these steps closely.

## Using the Released Query
You should have access to a query titled "Campus 5 Applicants - Released".  This query has a filter for those who do not have an interaction of the congrats letter.

I recommend you have this query open on one side of your monitor. Next, we'll need to view Decision Letter Templates. You'll need to go the Database (gear icon). Next find "Letter Templates" under "Decisions".

You'll want to click on "Archived" on the right-hand side. Next, find the letter called "CDE - Congrats Letter - UG".

## Filling in the blanks
On the viewer for the letter, click "Preview Letter" on the right-hand side. Next, type in the name of an applicant from the query.

When you click Display, it should fill out the letter with their information.

To download the letter as a PDF, click "Download PDF" on the right-hand side. From here, you can print it out or save it as a file.

## Setting the interaction
Now that you've generated the congrats letter for the applicant, you'll need to add the letter as an interaction to the applicant's record--that way we don't send it to them twice.

From the query view, click the applicant's name, then click "Lookup Record".

Next, go to their Timeline tab.

Click the "New Interaction" button on the right.

Set the code to "Physical Mailing". You should see a subcode field appear.

For subcode, choose "CDE UG Congrats Letter".

Click "Save".

You have generatead the congrats letter for that applicant. From the person record, you can click the Next button in the top right to go to the next person who needs a congrats letter and repeat the process.
