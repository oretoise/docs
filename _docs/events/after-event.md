# Registering Prospects after an Event
{: .no_toc }

Say you need to add prospects to an event after the event is over. Slate makes this very easy, but there are several pitfalls. Read on to see where to go.

1. TOC

## Pull up the event in Slate.
Simply login to [Slate](https://goto.msstate.edu/manage) with your netID and netPassword. If you cannot access Slate, contact [Jordan](mailto:jordan.scruggs@msstate.edu) via email.

Next, click on the Events tab up top.

From the calendar view, click on the event you wish to register someone for.

![Events Listing]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/events_listing.png)

## Verify the Event.
Ensure that the event you clicked on is:

* One of our events. It should be using the "CDE Events Template".
* The event that you intend to sign someone up for. (Verify the name, location, and date.)

## Fill out the Form.
Click on the "New Registration" link underneath "Registrants".

![New Registration Link]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/new_registration.png)

You will be taken to the signup form. This is where you will enter prospect cards or other signup data.

Simply fill out the form with the prospective student's info, and Slate will take care of the rest.

## Finished!
Repeat this for any more prospects that need to be registered with the event. If you have any questions or something isn't working, contact [Jordan](mailto:jordan.scruggs@msstate.edu) via email.  If any part of this guide is incorrect, let me know and I will update it.
