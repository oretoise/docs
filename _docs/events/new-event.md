# Creating a New Event
{: .fs-9 }

If someone is attending a conference or event and plans to recruit students, you'll need a Slate form for them to pull up at the event. Prospective students can fill out the form, and their submission is automatically linked back to the event.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Required Information
You'll need the following data points to create a new event in Slate.

* Event Name (Unique)
* Start and End dates
* Event location
* Event description

## Creating the Event
This will walk you through each step of creating a new event in Slate, setting the appropriate fields, and testing your event form.

### Login to Slate
First, login to [Slate](https://goto.msstate.edu/manage) with your netID and netPassword. If you cannot access Slate, contact [Jordan](mailto:jordan.scruggs@msstate.edu) via email.

### Navigate to the Events homepage.
Move your mouse over the calendar icon in the top row.

### Fill out the "New Event" form.
Click on the "New Event" button.

You should see the following form appear.

Type the name of the event in the "Page Title" field as follows:

Open the template list by clicking on the dropdown:

Select the "CDE Events Template".

Open the folder list by clicking on the dropdown:

Select the "Distance" folder.

Open the status list.

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/status_dropdown.png)

Set the status to "Confirmed/Active".

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/status_select.png)

Set the start date by clicking the first field next to "Date":

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/start_date_select.png)

Set the end date by clicking the field after "until":

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/end_date_select.png)

Set the deadline to sometime after the event so that you can still register any stragglers.

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/deadline_date_select.png)

Click the "Location" tab on the top and enter in the event's address.

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/location.png)

Click "Save" at the bottom.

### Edit the Event URL

You should be taken to the event's details page.

Click on the "Edit URL" link around the middle of the page.

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/edit_url.png)

Choose a **unique** landing page URL for this. You **cannot** have spaces in the URL!  For example, if you are attending the 2019 UPCEA conference, choose something like "upcea_2019".

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/url_field.png)


### Test the Form
From here, right-click on the now-customized URL and click "Open Link in New Tab". 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/link_new_tab.png)

You should be able to see the form, like so. If you do not, check to make sure you set the dates correctly.

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/event_form.png)

If the form is live, copy the URL for the registration page and **email** it to anyone attending the event.

## Acquire Students
While the event attendee is present at their booth, simply open the form on an internet-equipped device for prospective students to fill out. Laptops are preferred, but tablets and mobile devices can also work.


## Finished!
Your form should be up and running with its submissions tied back to the event. If you have any questions or something isn't working, contact [Jordan](mailto:jordan.scruggs@msstate.edu) via email.  If any part of this guide is incorrect, let me know and I will update it.
