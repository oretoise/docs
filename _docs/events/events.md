# Slate Events
{: .no_toc }

The Events features in Slate help us track everything revolving around conferences, community college fairs, and much more that our program coordinators attend.  Perhaps the most important is keeping track of the prospective students gained at these events and watching their movement through the funnel.

## Events
Events are found by clicking on the Calendar icon in the top row from within [Slate](https://goto.msstate.edu/manage).

![Events Button]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/events/events_nav.png)

From here, you can see a calendar view of events, whether they are active or still tentative.

## Registration
Connecting a prospect to a record has always been a challenge in Recruit and by hand.  Fortunately, Slate makes this process simple. Jordan created a template for all of our events to use. This includes a univeral registration form.  Simply create the event using the template, test it out, and you are good to go.

## Creating New Events
To create a new event within Slate for CDE usage, follow this [guide](/docs/events/new-event).

## Retrieving Prospects
Follow the to-be-created walkthrough on this.

## Questions?
As always, if you have any questions about using Slate or the Events feature, simply contact [Jordan](mailto:jordan.scruggs@msstate.edu) via email.
