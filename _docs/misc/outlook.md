## Adding an email to a Person Record
To get started, simply open or select an email from a prospect.

In the Outlook toolbar, click the "Add-Ins" tab.

Click "Technolutions Slate"

### Login to Slate
If you see the following, you'll need to log in to Slate. This can happen due to closing Outlook, restarting your computer, or your session expiring.

You will be taken to CAS. Simply enter your netID and netPassword, hit Enter (or click Login), and go through Duo as necessary. You may have to scroll down.

### Selecting the Record
Once logged in, you will see the following:

![Email details.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/misc/outlook/email_details.png)

Check the "Record" detail. If it says "No matching record found.", click on Relink.

![Relink to record.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/misc/outlook/relink.png)

If you need to relink to a prospect record, type in their first and last name, like so:

![Relinking to me]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/misc/outlook/relink_me.png)

You should see their name pop up. If they don't exist, close the window, click on Technolutions Slate again, and then click Create Record to create their prospect record right from Outlook.

Click on the record result, and the field will update to their name in Slate.

Finally, click "Add to File".
