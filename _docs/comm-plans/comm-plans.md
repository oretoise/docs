## Getting started
This is a collection of files, consisting of a Laravel installation, Python scripts, and current communication plan emails. It is designed to automate as much of the development process as possible.

### Dependencies

* A webserver. I personally use a LAMP (Linux-Apache-PHP-MySQL) stack on a Dell 990 for this. It doesn't need anything powerful.
* A text editor, with or without integrated Git support. I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Some familiarity with Git if you wish to use it.

## Setup Guide
If you need to set up a webserver for use with this, follow the [Setup Guide](/docs/comm-plans/setup)

## Scripts
I have written several Python scripts to automate as much as possible when it comes to authoring communication plans and setting them up in Slate. You can find them all [here](/docs/comm-plans/scripts/).
