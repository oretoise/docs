# Creating a Communication Plan

## Requirements
* The URL for the program website. 

## Creating the Skeleton
Once you know the acronym or URL segment for the program, simply run the [Plan Generation script](//docs/comm-plans/scripts/create-plan/).

### Signatures
The signature argument specifies which signature file to use. If you give it `jscruggs`, it will use `resources/views/signatures/jscruggs.blade.php`. If you need to create a new signature file, simply make it, name it what you want, and request it in when you run that script.
