# Setup Guide for Communication Plans
Setting up the Slate repository is the easiest way to create and maintain communication plans for each of the programs. It's filled with automations and scripts to make your job much easier.

## Requirements
The repository works as a Laravel web application, meaning it requires a machine to act as a webserver. To make this as simple as possible, Docker and Docker Compose are used.

You will need to install the [Docker engine](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on the machine you wish to act as the server.

## Repository
Additionally, you'll need a copy of the latest version of the repository. If you've been granted access to the repo on Github, you can access it [here](https://github.com/js2506/slate).

## Running the application.
TODO: Run the compose file, add any addl. commands necessary.
