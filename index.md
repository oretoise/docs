## Getting started

### Logging into Slate
If you have an account in Slate, you should be able to log in with your netID and netPassword [here](https://goto.msstate.edu/manage). You will be redirected to CAS, where you will be required to use 2-factor authenitcation. If you need help with 2FA, visit [2fa.msstate.edu](https://2fa.msstate.edu/start).

### Using the Docs
For walkthroughs on how to do various things in Slate, look to the menu on the left side, use the search feature at the top of the page, or click the hamburger menu on mobile. Do note that this is **not** intended to be a replacement for the built-in documentation in Slate. This is meant for Center for Distance Education customizations only. If you need help with a built-in feature of Slate and not with something customized by CDE, check the Slate documentation first. You can do this by clicking on the lightbulb icon in the top-left corner of any page within Slate.
